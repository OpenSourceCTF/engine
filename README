## dependencies


requires:
sfml 2.3
boost 1.58
box2d 2.3
make
c++11 compiler (i use g++)

## build

to build normally

`make -j`

to build debug mode

`make debug -j`

to build release mode

`make release -j`

to build without rendering enabled 
you could do `make debug` or `make release` here too

`make -j CXXFLAGS=-DDISABLE_RENDER`

## run

to convert map format

./tagos export IN_JSON IN_PNG OUT_JSON

to render map format

./tagos render MAP_FILE


--- recommended you export to /maps dir and read from /tp_maps
also - there is a `export_all_maps.sh` script which makes this more convenient for many maps
