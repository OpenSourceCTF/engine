## TODO

track stepping on toggles by players
    so we can tell when it is 2blue+1red or whatever
add game end conditions (time, score)
make gates pop players
serialize map data for server sync
destroy box2d bodies on destruct
implement game clear/restart
handle websocket movement input
    (will require an action queue)
send map deltas for server
    (will require a queue for updates)
handle chat
fix segfault on quit

---

run these to look for bugs

`grep -r "todo" src`
`grep -r "fixme" src`


## NETWORK

(idea of how network will work)
(current code very "exploratory" (read shitty))

start server-->

load list of maps in maplist.txt
    ensure all exist in folder

connect to database

lobby server starts
    starts X games
        2 threads - 1 for network, 1 for gameloop

(bootup is now complete)

client connects to lobby
    selects game it wants to join
        loads map from webserver over http
            (ensure maps are gzipped (if using nginx this is easy))

client says ready with login_token (so server can get user_id, name, degrees)
    server checks user and gets name, degrees, etc
    server responds with current state of map (all positions, players, etc)
    server adds clients ball (respawn)
    server notifies all clients of new ball

in future we plan for move to webrtc

## BUILD

itd be nice if the libraries were just in a folder and built correctly as part of makefile
maybe with subrepositories?
