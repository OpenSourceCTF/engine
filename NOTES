## TODO

remove players if they havent moved in X seconds
    unless they're by themselves
add game end conditions (time, score)
serialize map data for server sync
implement game clear/restart
fix segfault on exit

---

run these to look for bugs

`grep -r "todo" src`
`grep -r "fixme" src`


## NETWORK
client connects to lobby
selects game it wants to join
loads map from webserver over http
    (ensure maps are gzipped (if using nginx this is easy))

client says gamesync with login_token (so server can get user_id, name, degrees)
    server checks user and gets name, degrees, etc
    server responds with current state of map (all positions, players, etc)
    server adds clients ball (respawn)
    server notifies all clients of new ball

---

in future we plan for move to webrtc

---

look in the `./tests` folder for examples

## BUILD

itd be nice if the libraries were just in a folder and built correctly as part of makefile
maybe with subrepositories?
