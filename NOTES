## NETWORK

(this is assuming 1 server per game, easier for testing for rn)
(in future can just spawn multiple threads)

start server---

open port X for websocket

load list of maps in maplist.txt

ensure all exist in folder

connect to database

load first map

websocket to start

client connects
client says hello with login_token (so server can get user_id, name, degrees)

server replies with map id

client downloads map from webserver over http
    ensure maps are gzipped (if using nginx this is easy)

client says "ready"

server responds with current state of map (all positions, players, etc)
server adds clients ball (respawn)
server notifies all clients of new ball

--

in future we plan for move to webrtc
