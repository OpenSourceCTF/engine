## TODO

speed up compilation time

add invincibility for X tics after grabbing flag

remove players if they havent moved in X seconds
    unless they're by themselves

add game end conditions (time, score)
    game_finished event (which team won, any fun end of game only stats)
    new_game event (map name)
        need to have players let game know they are ready

vote player event

fix segfault on exit
fix crash on disconnect/reconnect (to reprod just run loadtest.js then kill it)

store player stats
    ideally we can support more than tagpro did
    probably by storing the stats with more detail
    ...
    total distance travelled?
    average speed?
    ...
    check todos

request player stats event

run these to look for bugs

`grep -r "todo" src`
`grep -r "fixme" src`

### ploff

chain vertices are shared_ptr - look at
get the good config values
return flag properly
explosions persist after pop?
toggles render incorrectly


## NETWORK
client connects to lobby
selects game it wants to join
loads map from webserver over http
    (ensure maps are gzipped (if using nginx this is easy))

client says gamesync with login_token (so server can get user_id, name, degrees)
    server checks user and gets name, degrees, etc
    server responds with current state of map (all positions, players, etc)
    server adds clients ball (respawn)
    server notifies all clients of new ball

---

in future we plan for move to webrtc

---

look in the `./tests` folder for examples

## BUILD

itd be nice if the libraries were just in a folder and built correctly as part of makefile
maybe with subrepositories?
